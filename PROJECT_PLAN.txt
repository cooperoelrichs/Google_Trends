Project Plan
------------

Need to develop a plan and a schedule to follow for working on this project.
1. NEED to check the Matrix/Array and plotted values against the original files to ensure that no
	miss-matching (eg. date or values get shifted, such that they don't match!) or data changing 
	is occuring in the scripts.
2. What is the ultimate goal?
3. What steps are required to achieve this?
4. What testing needs to be done?
5. How long should each step (and the whole project) take?

Current Goals
Done: 1. Read, process, and plot the ASX200 history from Yahoo
2. Compare the GTrend with the ASX200 trend
3. Begin mathematical analysis of the two trends (as per the Research Paper)
  ie. R value (see Paper or its appendix for formula or at least process?)
      - is it the formula in the comments accompanying the plots?
4. Check matrix/array and plot values against files (as per Goal 1)

Current Work
- Test new data_trend_analyzer
- change plotter to use data from data_trend_analyzer
